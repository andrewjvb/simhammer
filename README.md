# simhammer
## Overview

Simhammer is a tool for Warhammer 40k enthusiasts who are looking to maximize their army building experience. Using C++, this simulator will put your crafted army lists through a series of challenges meant to expose certain metrics by which you can visualize the viability of your army, and its strengths and weaknesses.

Typical unit-efficiency metrics do not go the distance in measuring the effectiveness of an army list, so Simhammer has arrived to fill the void of advanced data analysis.

## Using Simhammer

Until there is an official release, Simhammer will require you to build from source. If you're unable to do so, feel free to join our discussion on Discord and ask for some help there.

## Future Goals

Goals for the Simhammer project are broken down into a few phases. Phase 1 as we could call it, is to get the base engine for the simulator designed and implemented. Specifically, an engine to process army lists and extrapolate metrics based on several predefined scenarios.

Phase 2 would be to compile a database of all warhammer 40k units and abilities. This is ideally when we would be bringing on future contributors as this requires little-to-no software development knowledge. Phase 2 would also bring the Windows GUI to Simhammer, providing an interface for data input, list building, metric visualization, etc.

Further phases are TBD
